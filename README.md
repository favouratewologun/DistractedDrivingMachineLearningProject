# Distracted Driving Detection using Transfer Learning
This project focuses on building a multi-class image classification model to detect instances of distracted driving using transfer learning. The model was developed with Python and TensorFlow, ensuring optimized performance and high accuracy in classification.

## Project Overview
Distracted driving is a significant cause of accidents globally, and identifying such behavior through automated systems can help improve road safety. This project aims to classify images of drivers into different categories based on their behavior, such as using a cellphone, eating, or simply driving attentively.

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Framework: TensorFlow
Model Type: Transfer Learning for multi-class image classification
## Features
Utilizes transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models for enhanced accuracy.
Optimized for high performance using TensorFlowâ€™s efficient functions and tools.
Capable of categorizing driver behavior into multiple classes, providing actionable insights.
## Model Training
The model was trained using a dataset of labeled images representing various driver behaviors. By applying transfer learning techniques, the model adapted features from pre-trained neural networks, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Several optimization methods were used to enhance model performance, ensuring that it can accurately distinguish between different classes of driver behavior.

## Results
Achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting distracted driving behaviors.
Successfully classified multiple categories such as texting, phone calls, and inattentive driving with minimal misclassification.
## Future Enhancements
Integration with real-time video feeds for live detection.
Improvement of model accuracy through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
Deployment as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.
